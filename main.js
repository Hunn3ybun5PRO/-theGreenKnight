        a: "The farmer's daughter decided to live in the secluded outpost. Even though her father is very busy with his farm, she still gets to see him every day, if only for a brief time. However, there is always a chance of the woman finding the outpost and ruining everything. During her time in the outpost, the daughter started to notice something. In her dreams, there was one thing that was always there, a man dressed in all purple, in the middle of an oasis. The daughter can't decide whether to keep her dream to herself or to tell her father. A) Tell father about the dream B) Don't tell father about the dream.",

        aa: "The daughter decides to tell her father about her dream, and for the first time in years, she asks something of her father. She wants him to go and find the man of her dreams. He says he will and journeys for months trying to find the oasis his daughter saw in her dreams. One fateful day he finds it. While looking around he sees a man kneeling by a small pond, dressed in all purple. He goes to him and explains his daughter's dreams. The man says he has been having similar dreams, but with the daughter F. The father shows the man how to get to his daughter on a map and returns home. Three days later the man in purple shows up at the front door of the daughter's outpost, when she answers she is delighted to see it's the man in her dreams. They spend all their days together, but the man goes home every night. After two weeks of this, one of the farmhands that the step-mom brought from her cattle farm noticed a camel that was not theirs. He tells the stepmother, and she decides to find out for herself what is going on. That night she goes to the outpost and watches as a man dressed in all purple leaves on the camel. She plots a plan. The next day when the man is visiting, she goes to his camel and puts poison in his canteen. Later that night when the man was just arriving at his oasis, he faints. Over the next few days, the daughter grew very sad, with no word from the man she feared the worst. One day some birds began chirping outside her window. Birds were common there because it was one of the few places they could get water. They started chirping, but the daughter wasn't sure if she was in the mood to listen. A) Listen to the birds B) Don't listen to the birds. ",

She does as they asked, making sure to avoid anywhere the woman might be, and she saves the man.

        ab: "The girl decides not to tell her father, which most likely was a mistake. After about a year in the outpost, the stepmother's efforts for finding it finally paid off, and she was gonna make the daughter suffer. She remembers the father telling her about the explosives they used to start the moisture farm. She looks through all the storage units and eventually finds them. The next night she sets them at the base of the outpost, where all of the electrical equipment is, she sets a 20-minute timer and leaves. When they blow up the daughter was sleeping and had no idea what was going on. She tries to go out the door, but the frame had collapsed and she was trapped. Luckily, there was a farmhand nearby who heard the explosion. When he got there he saw through the rubble someone trying to find a way out. Being one of the three people who helped build the outpost, he remembered there was a back door that was never used. He rushes to the back, kicks in the door, and rushes to the daughter. She was huddled in the corner, but he picked her up and carried her out. The father was there when they got out, he was notified by an alarm in the main farmhouse. He knew right away the daughter couldn't stay there anymore. That night he gave her a speeder, a few days' worth of supplies, and told her to go as far away as possible. She very quickly starts to struggle.She's running low on everything, food, fuel, and especially water. On the second day, she stops to rest, the only thing on her mind is the possibility of repeating her mother's destiny, she closes her eyes and passes out. When she wakes, the daughter opens her eyes to dream catchers flowing in the wind, beautiful blue and red fabrics pitched like a tent. Then she sees it, a full jug of water. She starts drinking it is very surprised to find out it's cold water, she's only had cold water on her birthdays. She finishes the whole jug and feels much better. She looks around again, she was laying on a small mat, the same fabric the tent was made out of, besides that the shelter was empty. Seeing the slit for the entrance, she decides to go outside. When she gets out there are three large men dressed in red and blue ponchos along with shemaghs. They are also holding spears and have daggers in hilts on their waists, they were presumably some kind of guards. A woman is sitting on a small fold-out chair. She has a dress on made out of the same tent material, and nothing else. The daughter steps out, and the guards get into a crouched stance with their spears pointed out towards the girl. The sitting woman yells something and they return to standing quietly. The woman gestures for the daughter to come and sit with her, on another chair that was already set out. She sits and immediately asks the woman who she is. The lady responds with \"♣♦`♦TÄ█ .\" The daughter is taken aback, she thought gypsies were just a folk tale. The woman stands and gestures for the girl to follow. They go back into the tent, but it was completely different this time. There was no light shining through the fabric, it was completely black besides the candles jotted around the tent. There was no bare sand on the ground, it was now covered by the fabric. There was no mat on the ground, instead, there was a table, with a few candles and a deck of cards on it. The only thing that was the same was the dream catchers and the jug of water, which somehow refilled itself. The woman sits at the table, shuffles and cuts the deck of cards a few times, and starts flipping some of the cards face-up on the table. When she has flipped over five cards she motions the daughter to sit at the table. She sits and the woman starts talking. She explains that the cards are telling her that if the daughter travels west, she will find her destiny and the rest of her life. However, there will be something that will threaten her whole world, and it can only be saved by listening to the birds. The woman stands and walks out and to a camel behind the tent. She tells the girl the camel has everything she needs for her journey, she says good luck on her adventures and walks away. The daughter gets on the camel, and begins her journey.After many days of easy travel because of everything provided by the gypsies, she finds an oasis. She ties the camel to one of the trees and starts to wander around. After a few minutes, she sees someone sitting by a small pond. It was a man dressed in all purple. As she approached the man he turned around. Right away he smiled, got up, ran to the daughter, and hugged her. He said \"☻8◘-♪O.↓.\" Which means, \"At last, the woman in my dreams has come to me.\" Although the daughter is confused at first, it clicks in her head that this man is her destiny and the rest of her life, and returns the hug. They spend the next few days learning everything about each other, but this was short-lived. On the third day, when the daughter and her destiny were on a walk through the oasis, around 20 men on horseback come over the crest of the hill to the east of the oasis. They stop at the top and wait as another slower horse comes through the middle of the others, also cresting the hill. The daughter recognizes who it is right away, it is her evil stepmother. The only way she could have found the daughter is if someone from her farm followed the daughter when she left. No words were exchanged. The lady nodded to one of the men and he shot a dart at the man in purple. The daughter catches him as he falls, and while she's laying him down the evil woman and her mob leave. The man is sick right away. Over the next day, the daughter tends to him the best she can, but it doesn't seem to be helping. On the second day, she notices birds are chirping all over the place, but she is too focused on helping the man that she doesn't think to listen to them.

        b: "The farmer's daughter decided to take one of the land speeders. She and her father, in secret from the woman, gathered provisions. The speeder was small, but very fast, so she only needed enough for a few days before she found another settlement. It was a bittersweet moment when she left. Leaving her father was the last thing she ever wanted to do, but she would finally be rid of the awful woman. After a couple of days of travel, the daughter passes by some sort of farm. She isn't sure what it is. Running low on supplies, she decides to go ask for help. She comes up to a big gate with a name on it, and she feels like she recognizes it. But can't quite figure out why. At the gate a voice on an intercom comes on, it says \"AÑY äA◘♦☻♥.\" Which translates to \"What is your purpose for coming here?\" The daughter responds with \"☺♠♣◘♥§A0,\" meaning \"I seak food and shelter.\" The gate opens, and the daughter cautiously rides in. As she follows the road, she notices that it's a cattle farm, with cows everywhere. Then she sees it, the brands on the cows are the same as the mark on her stepmother's ring. She starts to panic and has to make a decision quickly. She can turn around and risk dying of dehydration in the desert, or she can keep going, and risk alerting her stepmother. A) Turn around B) Keep following the road. ",

He goes to him and explains his daughter's dreams, the man says he has been having similar dreams, but with the daughter instead. The father shows the man how to get to his daughter on a map and returns home. Three days later the man in purple shows up at the front door of the daughter's outpost, when she answers she is delighted to see it's the man in her dreams. They spend all their days together, but the man goes home every night. After two weeks of this, one of the farmhands that the step-mom brought from her cattle farm noticed a camel that wasn't one of the farms. He tells the stepmother, and she decides to find out for herself what is going on. That night she goes to the outpost and watches as a man dressed in all purple leaves on the camel. She plots a plan. The next day when the man is visiting, she goes to his camel and puts poison in his canteen. Later that night when the man was just arriving at his oasis, he faints. Over the next few days, the daughter grew very sad, with no word from the man she feared the worst. One day some birds began chirping outside her window. Birds were common there because it was one of the few places they could get water. They started chirping, but the daughter wasn't sure if she was in the mood to listen. A) Listen to the birds B) Don't listen to the birds",

They were telling her that to save the man in purple she needed to get three lizards to make a soup with. Then, she needed to feed that soup to the man nine times. She does as they asked, making sure to avoid anywhere the woman might be, and she saves the man.

        bbbab: "The girl decides not to tell her father, which most likely was a mistake. After about a year in the outpost, the stepmother's efforts for finding it finally paid off, and she was gonna make the daughter suffer. She remembers the father telling her about the explosives they used to start the moisture farm. She looks through all the storage units and eventually finds them. The next night she sets them at the base of the outpost, where all of the electrical equipment is, she sets a 20-minute timer and leaves. When they blow up the daughter was sleeping and had no idea what was going on. She tries to go out the door, but the frame had collapsed and she was trapped. Luckily, there was a farmhand nearby who heard the explosion. When he got there he saw through the rubble someone trying to find a way out. Being one of the three people who helped build the outpost, he remembered there was a back door that was never used. He rushes to the back, kicks in the door, and rushes to the daughter. She was huddled in the corner, but he picked her up and carried her out. The father was there when they got out, he was notified by an alarm in the main farmhouse. He knew right away the daughter couldn't stay there anymore. That night he gave her a speeder, a few days' worth of supplies, and told her to go as far away as possible. She very quickly starts to struggle.She's running low on everything, food, fuel, and especially water. On the second day, she stops to rest, the only thing on her mind is the possibility of repeating her mother's destiny, she closes her eyes and passes out. When she wakes, the daughter opens her eyes to dream catchers flowing in the wind, beautiful blue and red fabrics pitched like a tent. Then she sees it, a full jug of water. She starts drinking it is very surprised to find out it's cold water, she's only had cold water on her birthdays. She finishes the whole jug and feels much better. She looks around again, she was laying on a small mat, the same fabric the tent was made out of, besides that the shelter was empty. Seeing the slit for the entrance, she decides to go outside. When she gets out there are three large men dressed in red and blue ponchos along with shemaghs. They are also holding spears and have daggers in hilts on their waists, they were presumably some kind of guards. A woman is sitting on a small fold-out chair. She has a dress on made out of the same tent material, and nothing else. The daughter steps out, and the guards get into a crouched stance with their spears pointed out towards the girl. The sitting woman yells something and they return to standing quietly. The woman gestures for the daughter to come and sit with her, on another chair that was already set out. She sits and immediately asks the woman who she is. The lady responds with \"♣♦`♦TÄ█ .\" The daughter is taken aback, she thought gypsies were just a folk tale. The woman stands and gestures for the girl to follow. They go back into the tent, but it was completely different this time. There was no light shining through the fabric, it was completely black besides the candles jotted around the tent. There was no bare sand on the ground, it was now covered by the fabric. There was no mat on the ground, instead, there was a table, with a few candles and a deck of cards on it. The only thing that was the same was the dream catchers and the jug of water, which somehow refilled itself. The woman sits at the table, shuffles and cuts the deck of cards a few times, and starts flipping some of the cards face-up on the table. When she has flipped over five cards she motions the daughter to sit at the table. She sits and the woman starts talking. She explains that the cards are telling her that if the daughter travels west, she will find her destiny and the rest of her life. However, there will be something that will threaten her whole world, and it can only be saved by listening to the birds. The woman stands and walks out and to a camel behind the tent. She tells the girl the camel has everything she needs for her journey, she says good luck on her adventures and walks away. The daughter gets on the camel, and begins her journey.After many days of easy travel because of everything provided by the gypsies, she finds an oasis. She ties the camel to one of the trees and starts to wander around. After a few minutes, she sees someone sitting by a small pond. It was a man dressed in all purple. As she approached the man he turned around. Right away he smiled, got up, ran to the daughter, and hugged her. He said \"☻8◘-♪O.↓.\" Which means, \"At last, the woman in my dreams has come to me.\" Although the daughter is confused at first, it clicks in her head that this man is her destiny and the rest of her life, and returns the hug. They spend the next few days learning everything about each other, but this was short-lived. On the third day, when the daughter and her destiny were on a walk through the oasis, around 20 men on horseback come over the crest of the hill to the east of the oasis. They stop at the top and wait as another slower horse comes through the middle of the others, also cresting the hill. The daughter recognizes who it is right away, it is her evil stepmother. The only way she could have found the daughter is if someone from her farm followed the daughter when she left. No words were exchanged. The lady nodded to one of the men and he shot a dart at the man in purple. The daughter catches him as he falls, and while she's laying him down the evil woman and her mob leave. The man is sick right away. Over the next day, the daughter tends to him the best she can, but it doesn't seem to be helping. On the second day, she notices birds are chirping all over the place, but she is too focused on helping the man that she doesn't think to listen to them. A) Listen to the birds B) Don't listen to the birds.",
